## Features
- Data cleaning and aggregation of customer orders.
- Payment value distribution analysis.
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for identifying top customers.
- Correlation heatmaps and histograms for exploratory data analysis.
- Dynamic filtering and interactive visualizations.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.7+ installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:
1. Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the Streamlit app
```
cd dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

# Usage
## Data Overview
The dashboard provides a summary of customer orders, products, and payment data. The user can select the desired time range and view the following insights:

- Customer Order Information: Overview of customer orders and basic dataset statistics.
- Missing Data Assessment: Summary of missing data across different columns in the datasets.

## Visualization & Explanatory Analysis
Visualize the following metrics using various charts:

- Payment Value Distribution: Histogram showing the distribution of payment values across orders.
- Order Frequency Distribution: Histogram (with a log scale) of how many orders customers have made.
- Correlation Heatmap: Heatmap of correlation between variables such as payment value and quantity.

## RFM Analysis
Perform RFM analysis to identify top customers based on:

- Recency: How recently customers made a purchase.
- Frequency: How many purchases the customers made.
- Monetary: The total monetary value of purchases by each customer.

The dashboard also allows you to visualize the top customers based on these metrics.
